# Landing Page Project

This landing page project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project was to create a simple yet visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The landing page consists of the following sections:

1. **Header**: The header section contains the website logo and navigation links to different sections of the page.

2. **Carousel Section**: The carousel section showcases images or content in a rotating carousel/slider. Users can navigate through the carousel to view different images or content.

3. **Quote Section**: This section features a compelling quote or testimonial from a satisfied customer or user of the product/service.

4. **CTA (Call to Action) Section**: The CTA section includes a prominent call-to-action button, encouraging users to take action such as signing up for a service, downloading an app, or exploring more about the product or service offered.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the content of the landing page.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout of the page elements.
- Responsive Design: Implemented to ensure the landing page looks good and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
